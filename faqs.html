      <button class="accordion-button">What is Gross Pay?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
         <p>The <span class="font-weight-bold">Gross Pay</span> figure on your payslip represents your total earnings before any taxes or contributions are deducted. It's important to understand Gross Pay as it forms the basis for calculating your net pay (take-home pay) after all deductions.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-button">Your Personal Allowance</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>All UK resident individuals and certain non-resident individuals earning under £100,000 per year are entitled to a <span class="font-weight-bold">Personal Allowance</span> of £12,570. This amount of income can be earned tax-free. Any income over this allowance is subject to tax.</p>
        
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-button">Income Tax Rates</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold pt-1">Up to £12,570:</span> Tax-free (Personal Allowance)<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold pt-1"> £12,571 to £50,270: </span>20% (Basic Rate)<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold pt-1"> £50,271 to £125,140: </span>40% (Higher Rate)<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold pt-1"> Over £125,140: </span>45% (Additional Rate)<br><br>
        For every £2 earned over £100,000, the personal allowance is reduced by £1. Therefore, by the time income reaches £125,140, the personal allowance is completely phased out, effectively increasing the taxable amount at the basic rate.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-button">PAYE System</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Pay As You Earn (PAYE)</span> works by calculating your entitlement to personal allowance, basic rate, and higher rate on a year-to-date basis. This means it accounts for all income received to date, ensuring correct tax collection throughout the year. If there's a break in your employment, the PAYE system helps to ensure the right amount of tax is collected for the entire year.</p>

      <button class="accordion-button">Understanding National Insurance for Employees</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold faq-title">National Insurance (NI)</span> is a system in the UK where both workers and employers make contributions to fund benefits like the State Pension, unemployment benefits, and the NHS. These contributions are deducted from wages.</p>
        <p>The purpose of NI is to secure your pension upon retirement, support the unemployed, disabled, or those on maternity leave, and contribute to the National Health Service.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Class 1:</span> Paid by employees and employers on earnings.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Class 2:</span> Paid by self-employed individuals.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Class 3:</span> Voluntary contributions to fill gaps in the NI record.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Class 4:</span> Additional contributions paid by self-employed individuals on profits.</p>
        <p>NICs are based on earnings, with different rates applying above and below certain thresholds. Employers use the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system to deduct NICs from wages before they are paid to you. Your payslip will detail these NICs along with other deductions like Income Tax.</p>

      <button class="accordion-button">Understanding your UK Tax Code</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Your <span class="font-weight-bold"> tax code </span>tells your employer how much Income Tax to take from your pay. It usually has numbers and letters.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Numbers: </span>Show your tax-free allowance. For example, if your code is 1257L, you can earn £12,570 before paying tax.</p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Letters:</span> Explain your tax situation. Common ones include:<br><br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">L:</span> Standard tax-free amount.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">M:</span> You've received the Marriage Allowance from your partner.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">N:</span> You've given the Marriage Allowance to your partner.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">BR:</span> All your income is taxed at the basic rate <span class="highlight">(often if you have a second job).</span><br><br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Example of Tax Codes:</span><br><br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">880L:</span><span> Indicates that the employee has some reason for a restricted personal allowance of £8,880. Next is the L, this denotes that the person is under 65 years young and they earn under £100,000 per year.</span><br>
        <br>Your tax code can change, so it's important to check your payslips and contact HMRC if something looks wrong.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion-button">How can I check my Tax Code is correct?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Check Your Payslip:</span> Your tax code will be displayed on your payslip. Ensure it matches the tax code provided by HMRC.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Review your Personal Tax Account:</span> Log in to your Personal Tax Account on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account" class="font-weight-bold">HMRC website</a> to view your tax code and details about how it's calculated.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Check for Changes:</span> If you’ve had changes in your job, salary, or personal allowances (like Marriage Allowance), your tax code may have been updated.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Contact HMRC:</span> If you think your tax code is incorrect, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc" class="font-weight-bold">contact HMRC.</a> They can confirm your correct tax code and issue a new one if necessary.</p>
      </div>
  
      <button class="accordion-button">What happens if I'm overpaid?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="fs-sm-1">
          If you're overpaid, your employer will notify you about the mistake and explain how they'll recover the excess amount. They might deduct it from your future wages or set up a repayment plan. It's important to check your payslips and contact your payroll department if you notice any discrepancies.<br><br>
          The ACAS guidelines state that an employer <span class="font-weight-bold">should</span> not deduct money from their employee's wages without letting them know.<br><br>
          It is worth noting that within the ACAS guidelines <span class="highlight">the word 'should' is used to indicate what Acas considers to be good employment practice, rather than legal requirements.</span> The word <span class="font-weight-bold">'must'</span> is used to indicate where something is a legal requirement.
