      <button class="accordion-button">What is my Gross Pay?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Gross Pay</span> refers to the total income earned before any deductions for Income Tax and National Insurance. It includes:</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Basic Salary/Income:</span> Your regular earnings.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Additional Earnings:</span> This can include bonuses, overtime or holiday pay for casual hours worked.</p>
        <p>This figure represents your total earnings before any taxes or contributions are deducted. It's important to understand Gross Pay as it forms the basis for calculating your net pay (take-home pay) after all deductions.</p>

      <button class="accordion-button">Understanding your UK Tax Code</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Your <span class="font-weight-bold"> tax code </span>tells your employer how much Income Tax to take from your pay. It usually has numbers and letters.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Numbers: </span>Show your tax-free allowance. For example, if your code is 1257L, you can earn £12,570 before paying tax.</p>

        <span class="font-weight-bold">L:</span> Standard tax-free amount.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">M:</span> You've received the Marriage Allowance from your partner.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">N:</span> You've given the Marriage Allowance to your partner.<br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">BR:</span> All your income is taxed at the basic rate <span class="highlight">(often if you have a second job).</span><br><br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Example of Tax Codes:</span><br><br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">880L:</span><span> Indicates that the employee has some reason for a restricted personal allowance of £8,880. Next is the L, this denotes that the person is under 65 years young and they earn under £100,000 per year.</span><br>
        <br>Your tax code can change, so it's important to check your payslips and contact HMRC if something looks wrong.</p>

      <button class="accordion-button">How can I check my Tax Code is correct?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Check Your Payslip:</span> Your tax code will be displayed on your payslip. Ensure it matches the tax code provided by HMRC.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Review your Personal Tax Account:</span> Log in to your Personal Tax Account on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account" class="font-weight-bold">HMRC website</a> to view your tax code and details about how it's calculated.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Check for Changes:</span> If you’ve had changes in your job, salary, or personal allowances (like Marriage Allowance), your tax code may have been updated.</p>
        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Contact HMRC:</span> If you think your tax code is incorrect, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc" class="font-weight-bold">contact HMRC.</a> They can confirm your correct tax code and issue a new one if necessary.</p>

      <button class="accordion-button">What happens if I'm overpaid?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="fs-sm-1">
          If you're overpaid, your employer will notify you about the mistake and explain how they'll recover the excess amount. They might deduct it from your future wages or set up a repayment plan. It's important to check your payslips and contact your payroll department if you notice any discrepancies.<br><br>
          The ACAS guidelines state that an employer <span class="font-weight-bold">should</span> not deduct money from their employee's wages without letting them know.<br><br>
          It is worth noting that within the ACAS guidelines <span class="highlight">the word 'should' is used to indicate what Acas considers to be good employment practice, rather than legal requirements.</span> The word <span class="font-weight-bold">'must'</span> is used to indicate where something is a legal requirement.
