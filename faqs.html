        <p>Your <span class="font-weight-bold"> tax code </span>tells your employer how much Income Tax to take from your pay. It usually has numbers and letters.</p>
          <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Key Parts:<br>Numbers: </span>Show your tax-free allowance. For example, if your code is 1257L, you can earn ¬£12,570 before paying tax.</p>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Letters:</span> Explain your tax situation. Common ones include:<br>

            <span class="font-weight-bold">L:</span>Standard tax-free amount.<br>
            
            <span class="font-weight-bold">M:</span> You've received the Marriage Allowance from your partner.<br>
            
            <span class="font-weight-bold">N:</span> You've given the Marriage Allowance to your partner.<br>
            
            <span class="font-weight-bold">BR:</span> All your income is taxed at the basic rate <span class="highlight">(often if you have a second job).</span><br>

              If your code is 1257L, you can earn ¬£12,570 tax-free.<br>
              Your tax code can change, so it's important to check your payslips and contact HMRC if something looks wrong.</p>

        What happens if I'm overpaid?
      </button>
      <div class="acc-content">
        <p class="fs-sm-1">
          If you're overpaid, your employer will notify you about the mistake and explain how they'll recover the excess amount. They might deduct it from your future wages or set up a repayment plan. It's important to check your payslips and contact your payroll department if you notice any discrepancies.<br><br>
          The ACAS guidelines state that an employer <span class="font-weight-bold">should</span> not deduct money from their employee's wages without letting them know.<br><br>
          It is worth noting that within the ACAS guidelines <span class="highlight">the word 'should' is used to indicate what Acas considers to be good employment practice, rather than legal requirements.</span> The word <span class="font-weight-bold">'must'</span> is used to indicate where something is a legal requirement.
